        lyrics : `Let me talk about the things I need for a minute
        Lent a knee and won't you come and see it for a while?
        I miss us riding home at 4:00 a.m., do you remember?
        Birds applaud as we turn into your street
        And although these photo albums don't quite paint it right
        There's a video that plays inside my mind
        And of all the things I miss, I miss the view
        I miss the way you look beneath the streetlights and the moon
        And of all the things I miss, the taste of you
        The taste of you on me, and me on you
        I often wonder if my finest days are behind me
        We were living in a golden haze so free
        I miss us dancing in the midnight rain, do you remember?
        Upstage and springtime and the days they change right in front of me
        And although these photo albums don't quite paint it right
        There's a video that plays inside my mind
        And of all the things I miss, I miss the view
        I miss the way you look beneath the streetlights and the moon
        And of all the things I miss, the taste of you
        The taste of you on me, and me on you
        I'll forever inspire, like time was a canvas we painted
        Looking back, I see colors and those colors ain't fading
        Still, we're growing, we're changing
        Still, sometimes I need saving
        But looking back, I see colors
        And of all the things I miss, I miss the view
        I miss the way you look beneath the streetlights and the moon
        And of all the things I miss, the taste of you
        The taste of you on me, and me on you
        And of all the things we've learned from each other
        I discovered how the love with you
        Beneath the streetlights and the moon
        And of all things we caused
        One another, I discovered how the love with you
        Beneath the streetlights and the moon
        Looking back, I see colors`

        lyrics: `No, I don't know how to save this,
        You just had to go and break it,
        Now the floor is caving in mm
        Look at all the time you wasted
        You were way too scared to face it
        If you told me at the start, then maybe
        But you took it too far, too little, too late
        Too much to call a mistake
        Now even when I look you in the eyes, I don't recognize them
        Too long, too broken, too changed
        To go back to the same place
        Now even when I look you in the eyes, I just can't decide if I can trust
        We're off balance
        I'm stuck in the middle
        Hurts more than a little (oh)
        Now it's all off balance, off balance
        I'm stuck in the middle
        Hurts more than a little, oh 'cause it's all off balance
        How'd you make it seem so easy?
        Acting like you really need me
        Guess you didn't need me then, oh
        Now we're both alone and hurting
        Tell me, was it really worth it?
        Why didn't you let me in? (Why didn't you let me in?)
        'Cause you took it too far, too little, too late (oh)
        Too much to call a mistake (yeah)
        Now even when I look you in the eyes, I don't recognize them (I don't recognise)
        Too long, too broken, too changed
        To go back to the same place
        Now even when I look you in the eyes, I just can't decide if I can trust
        We're off balance
        I'm stuck in the middle, hurts more than a little (oh)
        Now it's all off balance, off balance (yeah)
        I'm stuck in the middle
        Hurts more than a little, oh 'cause it's all off balance
        Hanging by the thread of our past (oh)
        We're out of place, you're out of mind
        I'm out of love, we're out of time
        Someone told me good things don't last (they don't last)
        And they were right, I guess it's true
        We can't go back to me and you (you)
        We're off balance
        I'm stuck in the middle, hurts more than a little
        'Cause it's all off balance, off balance, yeah, yeah
        I'm stuck in the middle, oh, 'cause it's all off balance`
